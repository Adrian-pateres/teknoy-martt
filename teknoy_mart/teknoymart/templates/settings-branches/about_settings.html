    <h1 class="about-title">About CIT-U eCommerce Platform</h1>

    <p class="about-text">
      The <strong>CIT-U eCommerce Platform</strong> is a secure and community-focused digital
      marketplace designed exclusively for the students of <strong>Cebu Institute of Technology – University (CIT-U)</strong>.
      Built to enhance campus life and promote sustainable resource sharing, the platform enables students to conveniently
      <strong>buy, sell, and rent</strong> items within a safe, university-verified environment.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      A key component of the platform’s security is its <strong>university email authentication system</strong>, restricting access
      to users with valid <strong>@cit.edu</strong> email addresses. This ensures all participants are verified CIT-U members,
      reducing risks associated with public online marketplaces.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      The platform provides features like item listing, searching, filtering, rental posting, and an integrated
      <strong>messaging system</strong> for safe communication between buyers and sellers. These tools ensure smooth interactions
      and efficient transactions.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      From a technical standpoint, the system is powered by modern technologies: <strong>Django</strong> for backend logic,
      HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend, <strong>Supabase</strong> for secure database management, and <strong>Render</strong> for
      cloud deployment. Together, they ensure performance, reliability, and ease of maintenance.
